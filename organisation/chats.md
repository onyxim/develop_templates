## necessary features for corporate chats

# How to organize channels?

## two main principals for organising channels

separate by:
1. permissions levels - create chats for every level of permission. Usually from private to general.
1. themes - all participants in a chat have  same authority level (obvious) and shares one exactly theme

In real world it's good to combine this two approaches.
